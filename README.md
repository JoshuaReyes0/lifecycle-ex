Resolving Tickets
  - Open Ticket: This ticket would still need to be worked on and should be taken care of depending on priority and SLA.
  - Closed Ticket: This ticket was worked on but may need follow-up or was resolved only left in closed status in the case that it could reoccur. 
  - Resolved Ticket: This ticket was worked on and was completely resolved.
